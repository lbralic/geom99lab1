# My personal directions request

First, explore the various options through the Directions API https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/directions/get-directions. 

Be creative and use multiple parameters from the API documentation to earn a top grade. The rubric is listed in the bottom of the MarkDown document.

Note: MarkDown (.md) documents are not HTML and therefore are best viewed in the github.com website, not on the pages github.io page. Marking will occur using the github.com source. 

This is part of your first practical lab in Week 3 

1. A working URL properly documented in the MarkDown with a unique origin and destination earns 50%
2. Including one to four additional functioning unique parameters from the API earns 50-70%
3. Having 3 or more functioning unique/novel and well-thought out parameters from the API earns 70-90%. Explore the API documentation for parameters we have not used.
4. Tell the story of your route. Include more than 2 "stops", and/or including additional links to display PlaceIDs on Google Maps, or other innovative presentations earns 80%-100%.
